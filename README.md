# Microstrain Test
A lightweight meta-framework for automated testing with CMake and CTest. 

## Objectives
* Provide a common interface for test registration and discovery.
* Share custom assertions and utilities between test frameworks.
* Make it easy to install test frameworks.

## Dependencies
The only dependencies are the selected backend framework(s) to use. The following are the currently supported backends:

#### C
* [Unity](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity)

#### C++
* [Doctest](https://github.com/doctest/doctest)

## How to use
Two backend frameworks can be used at once: one for *C* and one for *C++*.
